          My name is Eric Fugleberg. I'm a recovering CPA and current software
          builder. I like bicycles, hockey, skiing, cooking and listening to
          garage rock.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've made a pact with myself to create a new piece of content everyday
          until further notice. Be on the lookout for new sites I've built, blog
          articles written (probably about hockey), or new recipes I'm
          experimenting with. If you have any book, food, or general
          recommendations, hit me up at eric.fugleberg@gmail.com. Thanks for
          stopping by.
